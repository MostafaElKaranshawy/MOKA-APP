DONE - postId, commentId, etc are stored in request params or request body?
DONE - app.use(middleWare to verify user to avoid duplicates)
DONE - restful routes names standards.
Done without making database
- token is sent in Authorization header{
    decoding => take userId
    compare wwith record in db (check for expiracy) 
    update expiry with each request
    refresh token{
        expriy in years
        refreshes the access token whenever expired //// quite advanced (between two backends)
    }   
}

Q: Why not just using th ejwt sign and verify functions?
sessions:
    session id primary key of table
    user_id
    token
    created_at
    updated_at
    expired_at

- photos, pdf, etc are on disk with db include path

- pagination -> limit, offset -> mapped to pages (page No - 1) * limit = offset


-> how to create from models files 
migrations in database (check it out)
how to call associations from the same class ?  (check githup if stuck)


DO:
    define foriegn keys directly in Tables
    migrations in database (check it out) try to change a column name
    with every action check token and session, bothhh
    put docker container and make requests to the docker container (locally)
